# Note
This repository is for archiving and documenting purposes only. This means that unless you are looking for a specific version of SOUP or wanting to do some research, it is highly recommended to look at the [Gamebanana page](https://gamebanana.com/guis/36087) instead.

# What is SOUP?
This mod recreates many of the renders that exist in-game with pretty Source Filmmaker reimaginings, whether it be the main menu or the class portraits. The aim of the project is to stay familiar to what you know, but giving everything a nice facelift. Currently, the mod remakes the following:
- Class portraits
- Main menu backgrounds
- Main menu characters
- Class selection renders
- Loading screen background

It solves a few design inconsistencies, too, with such bug fixes as:

- [Class Portraits] Fixes RED and BLU Pyro using wrong team-coloured canisters.
- [Class Portraits] Fixes beta Spy textures still being used.
- [Class Portraits] Fixes Demoman's eyepatch being on the wrong eye.
- [Main Menu] Fixes robot Scout and robot Spy having skintones for their heads.
- [Main Menu] Fixes Scream Fortress 2011 menu renders being over-saturated.
- [Main Menu] Fixes robot Soldier, robot Pyro, and robot Demo having team-coloured grenades.
- [Main Menu] Fixes robot Scout's dogtag floating in mid-air.
- And probably more fixes that I haven't spotted, yet.

# Why is SOUP?
Because, honestly, I got tired of looking at how dated a lot of the renders were. Some of the oldest renders in the game still date back to during the development of TF2 (looking at you, Spy). It has been roughly 15+ years since these images were created; let's get these up into the modern day, I figured.

# How is SOUP?
While I haven't finished writing everything with regards to the mod, the incomplete documentation and process to making SOUP can be found here: https://github.com/sloofy/soup/wiki.

# Does this mod work on Valve servers?
Yes, but the class selection renders won't work. They work fine in community servers such as [Uncletopia](https://uncletopia.com/) or [Creators.tf](https://creators.tf/), however.

# Mod compatibility
- If you want to use any custom HUD, download the "Art Only" version and follow the instructions in [this guide](https://github.com/Sloofy/soup/wiki/sv_pure-1-and-You). By default, SOUP is incompatible with custom HUDs.
- This mod only affects the UI / HUD, so most mods should work.
- CriticalFlaw's [Community HUD Fixes](https://gamebanana.com/mods/26450) is already in SOUP.
- Tkain's [Absolutely HD Item Icons](https://gamebanana.com/mods/316151) is already in SOUP via the Community HUD Fixes project.
- Other mods that add more characters to the main menu are incompatible, such as Potassium Birb's [Main Menu Characters Overhaul](https://gamebanana.com/mods/294786) or [Maggot's Overhauled Portraits](https://gamebanana.com/guis/36284).
- This mod is compatible with mods that change the loading screen class icons / match round class portraits.
- Any mods using the mod_textures.txt file will not work, as it is used in this mod to control higher resolution class selection renders in the disguise kit menu (mods such as Hootaro_Hoestar's [Consistent and Missing Kill Icons](https://gamebanana.com/mods/25953)).
