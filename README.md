# Sloofy's Overhauled UI Portraits (SOUP)
When you disable the 3D player model, you get a crusty looking jpeg (or rather, a .vtf) of the class you’re playing as. Ever notice how the class portraits are using beta / inconsistent models for the mercs? With the funky shading and various other bits? You most certainly have now that I’ve told you. Out of frustration, I remade every class portrait using Source Filmmaker and Krita.

This project is currently incomplete.

## What does this do?
It replaces all the old art assets that are used when the 3D player model is disabled with higher-quality SFM recreations. I tried being as faithful to the source material as I could.

## How do I install this?
Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Sloofy/soup/releases) and put it in your tf/customs folder.

## Will this work on sv_pure 1 servers? (Valve matchmaking; casual and official competitive modes)
No, it won’t, sadly. And honestly, I’m absolutely crushed by the fact that Valve prevents simple art asset changes such as what this mod does. This will, however, work on most community servers like creators.tf.
