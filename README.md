# Note
This repository is for archiving and documenting purposes only. This means that unless you are looking for a specific version of SOUP or wanting to do some research, it is highly recommended to look at the [Gamebanana page](https://gamebanana.com/guis/36087) instead.

# What is SOUP?
This mod recreates many of the renders that exist in-game with pretty Source Filmmaker reimaginings, whether it be the main menu or the class portraits. The aim of the project is to stay familiar to what you know, but giving everything a nice facelift. It solves a few design inconsistencies, too, with such bug fixes as:
- [Class Portraits] Fixes RED and BLU Pyro using wrong team-coloured canisters.
- [Class Portraits] Fixes beta Spy textures still being used.
- [Class Portraits] Fixes Demoman's eyepatch being on the wrong eye.
- [Main Menu] Fixes robot Scout and robot Spy having skintones for their heads.
- [Main Menu] Fixes Scream Fortress 2011 menu renders being over-saturated.
- [Main Menu] Fixes robot Soldier, robot Pyro, and robot Demo having team-coloured grenades.
- [Main Menu] Fixes robot Scout's dogtag floating in mid-air.
- And probably more fixes that I haven't spotted, yet.

# Why is SOUP?
Because, honestly, I got tired of looking at how dated a lot of the renders were. Some of the oldest renders in the game still date back to during the development of TF2 (looking at you, Spy). It has been roughly 15+ years since these images were created; let's get these up into the modern day, I figured.

While I haven't finished writing everything with regards to the mod, the incomplete documentation and process to making SOUP can be found here: https://github.com/sloofy/soup/wiki.
