SOUP is made using home-grown renders designed with modern day design standards in mind, built entirely from scratch. Zero AI upscaling. Consistency galore.

"Renders so good, you could mistake them for Smash fighters!"

Are you sick of 

As this mod remakes all the existing renders, it also happens to fix a few errors in live TF2. These include, but is not limited to:
 - Uses a higher quality compression method by default, at the expense of storage optimization.
 - [Class Portraits] Fixes RED and BLU Pyro using wrong team-coloured canisters.
 - [Class Portraits] Fixes beta Spy textures still being used.
 - [Class Portraits] Fixes Demoman's eyepatch being on the wrong eye.
 - [Main Menu] Fixes robot Scout and robot Spy having skintones for their heads.
 - [Main Menu] Fixes Scream Fortress 2011 menu renders being over-saturated.
 - [Main Menu] Fixes robot Soldier, robot Pyro, and robot Demo having team-coloured grenades.
 - [Main Menu] Fixes robot Scout's dogtag floating in mid-air.
 - And probably more fixes that I haven't spotted, yet.

 - Class portrait showcase
